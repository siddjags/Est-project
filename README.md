# NO<sub>2</sub> Concentration Prediction

Code and sample datasets for 18-752 Project.

This project predicts the Nitrogen Dioxide concentration in ppm (parts per million) on a given day by applying regression techniques such as Normal Discriminative Model, k-NN regression and Multi-layer perceptron on other quantities/features measured by an air quality sensor.
